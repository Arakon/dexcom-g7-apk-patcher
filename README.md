# Dexcom G7 APK-Patcher

Build your own android based `Dexcom G7.apk` without compatibility checks to run it on any device.

## ‚è¨ Download

Just download the modified `.apk` and install it on your phone.

You can find the most recent pre-build `.apk` [here](https://github.com/DiaKEM/dexcom-g7-apk-patcher/releases/latest)!

## What it solves?

It solves exactly this:

![Your device is incompatible](images/problem.png)

## Introduction

`Dexcom G7 APK-Patcher` is a simple tool which allows you to modify the official `.apk`-file. The patched `.apk` will disable compatibility checks 
to allow you the usage of any current android smartphone.

There were also similar approaches for the G6 `.apk` which offered the same capability. If you are interested you can just check it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dexcom/comments/fqvpsf/oc_build_your_own_dexcom_app_update_base_version/).

## Usage

### Requirements

* apktool
* apksigner
* git
* eventually more stuff :)

### Build

After installing all requirements you can proceed as following:

* Download official `Dexcom G7.apk`
* Place it in the root and name it `dexcom.apk`
* Run `bin/build.sh`
* Congratulations - you just have an patched `Dexcom G7.apk` without compatibility checks under `dexcom-mod.apk`

## Patches / Changes / Modifications

The official `.apk` receives only small changes to disable the compatibility check. For this purpose only one single file will be modified.
This file seems to be responsible for holding device specific data beside of app information. The applied patch only sets static values for `DeviceManufacturer`
and `DeviceModel` to overcome the compatibility check:

As you can see these values will be statically set to `Google` and `Pixel 4`.

## Technical background

The compatibility of dexcom will be done by some specific service. Therefore the app will collect device and app information and send it to this web-service.
The service then will check the information and respond to it.

### The HTTP Request

```http_request
POST https://watch.share-eu.dexcom.com/AppCompatibilityWebServices/Services/CheckValidity?applicationId=822b7625-68bd-4759-b1e7-24d7d1b44d28
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "AppName": "Dexcom G7",
  "AppVersion": "1.3.2.3326",
  "DeviceManufacturer": "Google",
  "DeviceModel": "Pixel 4",
  "DeviceOsName": "Android",
  "DeviceOsVersion": "11",
  "AppNumber": "SW12299"
}

```

If the information are okay the service will answer with:

```
{
  "Validity": "ValidEnvironment",
  "MessageId": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "MessageCacheId": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

Otherwise it will just say:

```
{
  "Validity": "InvalidUnsupportedEnvironment",
  "MessageId": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "MessageCacheId": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}

```

## The solution

What if it is possible to just set these values statically? Can we simply lie so that the compatibility service does not complain anymore?
This was the simple approach here. After disassembling the official `.apk` and checked the code i identified `dexcom/smali/ym/Iew.smali` as
main information unit for this purpose. And finally the problem was solved by adding two lines of code and changing another two.
